# Asset-backed-Security-Modeling-in-Python
● Applied object-oriented programming on dividing different types of loans, loan pool, security tranche, structured securities and 
simulation functionalities into proper classes.
● Imported loans from csv file into loan pool, computed metrics (IRR, reduction in yield, average life), and priced the structured 
securities using Monte Carlo method with multiple sub-processes to reduce runtime.
● Utilized advanced Python techniques: multiprocessing, numpy, pandas, error handling, decorators, string i/o, logging, datetime
